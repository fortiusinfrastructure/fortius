The goal is to contribute to the consolidation of a corpus of ideas with shared categories, capable of engaging with contemporary political theory without reducing itself to a mere reaction against other traditions.",
            "pillar2Title": "Hispanic Tradition in Dialogue with the West",
            "pillar2Desc": "The Hispanic tradition did not develop in isolation, but in constant dialogue with the rest of European and Atlantic thought. This axis examines those interactions—especially with the Anglo-American tradition—to understand how the modern world was shaped by multiple converging currents. The purpose is not to establish identity-based oppositions, but to reintegrate this tradition into the common Western narrative, highlighting its contribution to contemporary debates on liberalism, political community, and international order.",
            "pillar3Title": "Hispanic Tradition of Freedom",
            "pillar3Desc": "This axis explores the concrete ways in which freedom was articulated historically in the Hispanic world through institutions, charters, pacts, and mechanisms for limiting power. Rather than abstract or purely individualistic conceptions, the Hispanic experience developed an institutional and communal understanding of freedom. It also provides conceptual tools for addressing contemporary debates on social fragmentation, the crisis of institutional legitimacy, and the redefinition of the political order in the twenty-first century."
