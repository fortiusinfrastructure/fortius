The goal is to contribute to the consolidation of a corpus of ideas with shared categories, capable of engaging with contemporary political theory without reducing itself to a mere reaction against other traditions.",

            "pillar2Desc": "The Hispanic tradition did not develop in isolation, but in constant dialogue with the rest of European and Atlantic thought. This axis examines those interactions—especially with the Anglo-American tradition—to understand how the modern world was shaped by multiple converging currents. The purpose is not to establish identity-based oppositions, but to reintegrate this tradition into the common Western narrative, highlighting its contribution to contemporary debates on liberalism, political community, and international order.",
            "pillar3Title": "Hispanic Tradition of Freedom",
            "pillar3Desc": "This axis explores the concrete ways in which freedom was articulated historically in the Hispanic world through institutions, charters, pacts, and mechanisms for limiting power. Rather than abstract or purely individualistic conceptions, the Hispanic experience developed an institutional and communal understanding of freedom. It also provides conceptual tools for addressing contemporary debates on social fragmentation, the crisis of institutional legitimacy, and the redefinition of the political order in the twenty-first century."

            "receptionTitle": "Reception and Rediscovery",
            "introParagraph1": "From Escuela Hispánica we have promoted Project 1776; an ongoing research project marking the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America (1776–2026). This project explores the influence of the political thought of the Second Scholasticism—especially the School of Salamanca—on the intellectual origins of American constitutionalism and the defense of individual freedom against absolute power.",
            "introParagraph2": "Various authors have shown that many of the principles we today consider pillars of modern democracies and, in particular, of the American republic—such as human dignity, popular sovereignty, the limitation of power, or respect for individual conscience—were formulated centuries earlier by Catholic theologians and jurists of the 16th and 17th centuries. A key example is the famous formula of the Jesuit Francisco Suárez (1548–1617): “Omnis potestas a Deo, populum consentientem” (“All power comes from God, but through the consent of the people”). This conception of political power as delegated by the community—and not as an absolute authority granted directly to the monarch—dismantles the cliché that modern Catholic thought supported absolutism. In fact, it was often Protestant reformers, both Lutheran and Anglican, who sustained monarchical models \"by the grace of God\".",
            "introParagraph3": "The leading exponents of the School of Salamanca, influenced by Thomas Aquinas and headed by figures such as Francisco de Vitoria, Juan de Mariana, Robert Bellarmine, and Suárez himself, developed a theological-juridical vision of the political order based on natural law, moral law, and rationality. These ideas spread through universities, seminaries, and libraries, both in the Iberian Peninsula and in Hispanic America, constituting what we might today call an authentic “Hispanic tradition of liberty”.",
            "introParagraph4": "Traditionally, academic studies have focused on the impact of this tradition during the Hispanic American independence processes (1810–2010). Researchers such as Carlos Stoetzer, Fr. Furlong, or institutes and research centers like the Fe y Libertad Institute (Guatemala) have demonstrated how the scholastics influenced the emerging republican doctrines in Hispanic America, especially through the Jesuit educational network.",
            "introParagraph5": "However, Project 1776 broadens this horizon to also analyze its possible influence on the independence of the United States. Although the Anglo-Saxon world did not have a scholastic institutional infrastructure as developed as in Hispanic America, there are growing indications of the circulation and reception of authors from the Hispanic tradition—especially Suárez and Bellarmine—in the British colonies. This is suggested by works such as those of Rafael Termes, recent research on George Mason, and reflections like those of Professor Karl Maurer, who noted:",
            "introQuote": "“It is undeniable that Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, and George Mason, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, were well acquainted with the great classical and contemporary thinkers since Aristotle. And it is not unreasonable to conclude that they were also familiar with writers who defended popular sovereignty and opposed the absolute power of kings.”",
            "introQuoteSource": "Source: Catholic Culture",
            "introParagraph6": "A decade ago, the president of Escuela Hispánica, Alejandro Chafuen, proposed this line of research in an article published in Forbes: “Hispanics Finding Roots and Helping Build Our America”. More recently, José Sáenz Crespo took up this issue in an interview for the Intercollegiate Studies Institute with Juan A. Soto and Enrique Pallares, where the need to rediscover a “Hispanic tradition of liberty”, unjustly forgotten in Anglo-Saxon narratives, is defended.",
            "introParagraph7": "Thus, the objective of this project is not only to recover an intellectual genealogy alternative to the Enlightenment-Protestant narrative of the origins of the United States, but also to show how Catholic political philosophy—when based on the dignity of the person, natural law, and moral freedom—can contribute to the universal ideals of justice and limited government.",
            "introParagraph8": "Just as in recent decades the historical role of Spain in military terms in the independence of the United States has been vindicated—let us remember that it was Bernardo de Gálvez, and not Lafayette, who marched alongside George Washington in the victory parade—it is now time to also investigate the intellectual plane: the relationship between the political traditions that contributed to the philosophical pillars of those incipient united states of North America.",
            "introParagraph9": "The Hispanic tradition should not, therefore, be understood as an antagonist to the Anglo-American one, but as complementary and necessary to sustain the enormous weight of the Western project. It is a vast, rich, and chronologically earlier tradition, whose impact is increasingly evident both indirectly—through the Scottish Enlightenment—and directly on the Founding Fathers of the United States themselves. The West is not the exclusive product of a single intellectual current, but the sum of the Hispanic tradition, the Anglo-American one, and a constellation of minor continental European traditions; all of them necessary to support its moral, juridical, and political architecture. In this sense, Project 1776 aspires to vindicate the indispensable role of the Hispanic tradition, its deep connection with the Anglo-American one, and its responsibility in the intellectual and philosophical support of the West, frequently minimized over the last two centuries.",
            "introParagraph10": "This is, therefore, a history to be rediscovered, on the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and beyond.",
            "introParagraph11": "Project 1776 seeks not only to recover a forgotten intellectual genealogy, but also to offer an alternative vision—Hispanic, humanist, and Catholic—of the birth of modern constitutionalism."
